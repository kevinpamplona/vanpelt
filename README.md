# Van Pelt - YARN Job Killer

Van Pelt is a lightweight tool to kill all existing YARN jobs at once.

## TODO
- Update README w/ examples
- Safe-kill option (ask for confirmation)
- Provide bootstrap script for use during cluster provisioning 

## Why 'Van Pelt'?
The tool is named after [Van Pelt](http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Van_Pelt), the hunter antagonist from the 1995 film Jumanji.
